          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>
          At Holistic Kiwi we believe that everyone should be able to have access to quality skin care and massages. <br/>
          We offer massages and skin treatments that meet the highest international standards.
          </p>
          <h3>The Products</h3>
          <p>
          New Zealand is leading in skincare, due to having to cope with the highest UV rating in the world.<br/>
          They also have the world's best medical grade natural ingredients such as Manuka.<br/>
          Our products are carefully curated by Kitti, meaning we only stock the best products that New Zealand has to offer.
          </p>
          <h3>More than just a name</h3>
          <p>
          Our name reflects our core values.<br/>
          <b>Holistic</b> meaning; systems and their properties are viewed as wholes, not just as a collection of parts, and <b>Kiwi</b> or Kiwiana as in the New Zealand word for everyone and everything from our fun little island.

          <h3>Kitti</h3>
          <p>
            Kitti founded Holistic Kiwi when she was unable to find a skin and massage salon that met the standards that she was used to in New Zealand.
           </p>
          <p>
            Due to her personal struggle with Dermatitis, she understands the importance of quality products and honest therapists. After many years of training in Seido Karate, Kitti has had her fair share of injuries and is passionate about helping others reach their full potential.
           </p>
          <p>
            With international qualifications in Beauty Therapy, Spa Therapy and Body & Nutrition (CIBTAC, CIDESCO, NZQA, TCI), Kitti has been helping clients meet their goals for nearly 10 years.

          <h3>Mary</h3>
          <p>
            Beauty Therapist Mary Darbyshire (CIDESCO, ITEC, NZQA) joined the Holistic Kiwi team in early 2019. She and Kitti met randomly mid 2018, figured out they shared similar qualifications, and hit it off right away!
          </p>
          <p>
            Another Kiwi lass, she is also passionate about skin health, and loves learning about how the bodyâ€™s systems on the inside can reflect on the outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mary has suffered with Psoriasis, as well as Acne. Her first hand experience with these issues, coupled with her can do attitude, make her the perfect addition to the Holistic Kiwi Team!
          </p>
          <p>
            She has undergone more indepth massage training with Kitti, and is currently busy with a Holistic Therapy Diploma to add to her skill set which she hopes to complete by the start of 2020.
